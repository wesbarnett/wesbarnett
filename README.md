### About me

With over a decade of engineering, statistics, and data science experience, I lead a team of engineers in developing and supporting machine learning models related to transaction underwriting and severity management for our upmarket and mainstream segments at Capital One. I aim to solve business problems through the design and implementation of end-to-end machine learning products using Python, SQL, Spark, Docker, Kubernetes, and related technologies.

I have a PhD in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from Tulane University and multiple AWS certifications. I have also published in several research journals, including a paper in Science Advances on using machine learning to design polymer membranes for gas separation. I am passionate about applying my skills and knowledge to create innovative and impactful solutions that enhance customer experience and drive business value.With over a decade of engineering, statistics, and data science experience, I lead a team of engineers in developing and supporting machine learning models related to transaction underwriting and severity management for our upmarket and mainstream segments at Capital One.
